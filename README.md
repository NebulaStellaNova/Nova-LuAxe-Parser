### What is LuAxe ?
LuAxe is a version of lua with a mixture of haxe syntax.<br>
Variables like Maps and Arrays are formatted as they are in Haxe.<br>
Everything else is Lua Formatting.
## Scripts
Currently only state scripts are supported.<br>
To make a state script, the name of the script must start with the state class name.<br>
EXAMPLE: MainMenuState.luac
